# Modeling-Georgia-Recidivism
Utilizing recidivism data from the Georgia Department of Community Supervision [3], supervised models were created to learn what variables could lead to recidivism and test if models could predict recidivism with high accuracy. Unsupervised learning was run to determine if clusters could answer any questions toward optimal variables.
